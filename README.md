# hello-world
My introduction into the extraordinary world of web development. This is my Alpha and there is no Omega in sight.


Hi there, AP here. My goal is to become a Front End Web Developer and eventually become a proud memberof the Tech World. I am on Codecademy and currently on the track to finishing the Web Developer Module. I think tacos are amazing, Sailor Moon is awesome, and music is life.
